      <description>Python is one of the most commonly used coding languages within the modern era of computer science and statistical analysis. It is easy to use, efficient, and possesses a wide range of customization for the user to explore. For example, the package NumPyprovides methods to manipulate arrays and matrices mathematically.
import numpy as np #load the library NumPy and store as `np` x = np.array([[2,4],[6,8]]) # `np.array` is a specific method within the `np` package that creates an array x ## array([[2, 4], ## [6, 8]]) print(np.</description>

      <description>Brandon Do (bmd2482)  Data Wrangling and Data Exploration  Rubric Prerequisite: Finding appropriate data from at least two sources per the instructions above: Failure to do this will result in a 0! You will submit a .Rmd file and a knitted document (html/pdf).
0. Introduction (4 pts) Having a good education has always been something my parents have prioritized for me.
